# AutoHotKey_Scripts
This program takes user input from an XInput controller and maps it to complex keyboard input. 
It is used to play games similar to Diablo 3 using a controller. 

A video explaining its uses and how to set it up can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFW8WflLng)

The main program was coded in the AutoHotKey scripting language. The windows form configuration application was coded using C#
