First of all, I'd like to thank you for trying out my controller script! I worked very hard on it and I really hope you enjoy using it.
I appreciate all feedback or suggestions, so feel free to message me or reply to the thread/video where you found it.

This is my youtube channel, and you can find all updates here first:

When running the script, the game (Diablo III or otherwise) is HIGHLY recommended to be in windowed/windowed fullscreen mode.
Otherwise you may will not see the target or software cursor on the screen. The script must also be run as administrator if the game is.
Just to be safe, I'd run it in admin mode all the time. If for any reason you aren't getting any feedback from your controller, that'd be the first thing to try.

There are also 3 hotkeys for the script itself. These are F5, F10 and F12.
Unfortunatly these cannot be changed as they register on a thread separate from the main script.

F5 will reload the values from the config file. If change values in the profile's .ini just hit F5 and you won't have to relaunch the script.
F10 will pause the script so that you can use the mouse and keyboard normally (incase you want to alt tab)
F12 will terminate it completely.

Pretty simple stuff. Make sure you edit the config file to fit your custom keybindings, or the script won't do anything.

v3.0+
This version of the application comes with a WinForms configuration. Now you can edit the .ini in style! This application should be pretty straight forward.
It allows you to create, set, and change profiles for the script! Have a demon hunter that need certain keybindings and a barbarian that needs a different set?
Just create another .ini using the WinForm and setup the values how you'd like. Swap between them easily by hitting 'Set Profile' with the one you want to use selected.

v4.0+
This program has been re-programmed from the ground up! This means more features now and in the future with less work from me.
Unfortunatly, old .ini files are in-compatible and will have to be setup again.

v4.1
This script can now be used with mouse and keyboard!
I'm still working out the bugs so it's not quite perfect when using both a controller and mouse at the same time.
I hope to fix this later on since I'd like to support the Steam Controller with it's right pad being a mouse instead of a stick.
You can now also update all .inis from v4.0 to v4.1 with a simple press of a button in the config software.

v4.2
Added a targeting triangle option to help show where the user is currently targeting if needed.
Added offset values for the inventory. This is pixel based and does not scale with resolution to assist with ease of use.
Don't forget that you can update your inis to the new version without losing your settings using the config program!

DISCLAIMER!
Remember that this script is only a script. IT DOES NOT ALTER GAME FILES, NOR DOES IT READ ANY OF THEM.
It is a stand alone script, and will function exactly the same even if Diablo III is not even open.
For this reason you could say that this program is 'smart' but not 'wise'.
The script knows nothing about the game, so it will always perform actions regaurdless if they are possible or not.
For instance, Inventory mode must be enabled/disabled manually.
This means that it is NOT a hook or memory reader.

However, this does not mean that Blizzard or similar companies will not consider it a violation of their terms.
You still accept the risk that your account can be banned for any reason if Blizzard sees fit.
I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS DESCISION.
I provide the software as is, and am not obligated to make changes based on this type of feedback.
I can't control what happens with your account. You have been warned...
