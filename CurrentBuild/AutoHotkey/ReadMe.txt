First of all, I'd like to thank you for trying out my controller script! I worked very hard on it and I really hope you enjoy using it. 
I appreciate all feedback or suggestions, so feel free to message me or reply to the thread/video where you found it. 

This is my youtube channel, and you can find all updates here first:

When running the script, the game (Diablo III or otherwise) is RECOMMENDED to be in windowed/windowed fullscreen mode. 
Otherwise you may not see the target on the screen. The script must also be run as administrator if the game is. 
Just to be safe, I'd run it in admin mode all the time. If for any reason you aren't getting any feedback from your controller, that'd be the first thing to try.

There are also 2 hotkeys for the script itself. These are F10 and F12. 
Unfortunatly in this version, you cannot change them, but in the future you should be able to. 
F10 will pause the script so that you can use the mouse and keyboard normally (incase you alt tab) and F12 will terminate it completely.

Pretty simple stuff. Make sure you edit the config file to fit your custom keybindings, or the script won't do anything. 

Remember that this script is only a script. IT DOES NOT ALTER DIABLO III GAME FILES, NOR DOES IT READ ANY OF THEM. 
It is a stand alone script, and will function exactly the same even if Diablo III is not even open. 

That being said, you still accept the risk that your account can be banned for any reason if Blizzard sees fit, and I take no responsibility for their descision. 
This is not a hack or a mod and there is absolutly no reason it should happen, but I can't control what happens with your account. You have been warned.
