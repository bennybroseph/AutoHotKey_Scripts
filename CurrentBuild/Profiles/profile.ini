[Buttons]
; The format for all Buttons are as follows
; NameofKey = Modifier+KeyWhenPressed, Modifier+KeyWhenHeld
; Ommiting any of these values is fine, and the program will default to however many you include
;
; ex1. A_Button = Shift+LButton, Tab 
; ex2. A_Button = LButton
;
; For a full list of acceptable key names, check here: https://autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm
;
; The value 'Freedom' for a button toggles the left stick's cursor mode when pressed
; The value 'Loot' for a button spams the left click at the player's feet
Left_Trigger = Shift+LButton
Right_Trigger = RButton

Left_Shoulder = 1, 3
Right_Shoulder = 2, 4

A_Button = LButton
B_Button = 
X_Button = q
Y_Button = g

Start_Button = Esc
Back_Button = i, Inventory

D-Pad_Up = s
D-Pad_Down = t 
D-Pad_Left = f
D-Pad_Right = Tab, m

Left_Analog_Button = Freedom
Right_Analog_Button = Loot

; Force_Move should be set to your bound force move key from Diablo III
; It is what button is pressed whenever the left stick is not at rest
; For a game other than Diablo III, set this value to what you want the left stick to be bound to
Force_Move = Space

; Any keys put here will ignore the Right Analog Stick when using the controller button bound to it, 
; and will instead use the ability at the direction the Left Analog Stick
; Good abilities to use for this is the DH 'Vault' and the Barb 'Whirlwind'
; ex. Ignore_Target = 1, 4, t
;
; That would ignore the Right Analog Stick's position when firing off the 1, 4 and t keys
Ignore_Target =
